# CS231n-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Visual-Recognition
This repo contains my solutions to the 3 assignments of the course [CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2019/index.html) given by the University of Stanford in Spring 2019. <br />
The code is commented as much as possible. 

### Assignment 2: ###
* Q1: [Fully-connected Neural Network](assignment2/FullyConnectedNets.ipynb)
* Q2: [Batch Normalization](assignment2/BatchNormalization.ipynb)
* Q3: [Dropout](assignment2/Dropout.ipynb)
* Q4: [Convolutional Networks](assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb)
* Q5: [PyTorch](assignment2/PyTorch.ipynb) / [TensorFlow](assignment2/TensorFlow.ipynb) on CIFAR-10 (*done in both PyTorch and TensorFlow*)


### Assignment 3: ###
* Q1: [Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs](assignment3/RNN_Captioning.ipynb)
* Q2: [Image Captioning with LSTMs](assignment3/LSTM_Captioning.ipynb)
* Q3: [Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images](assignment3/NetworkVisualization-PyTorch.ipynb) (*done in PyTorch*)
* Q4: [Style Transfer](assignment3/StyleTransfer-PyTorch.ipynb) (*done in PyTorch*)
