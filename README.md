# CS231n-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Visual-Recognition
This repo contains my solutions to the 3 assignments of the course [CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2019/index.html) given by the University of Stanford in Spring 2019. 

### Assignment 3: ###
* Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs
* Image Captioning with LSTMs
* Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images (*done in PyTorch*)
* Style Transfer (*done in PyTorch*)
* [Generative Adversarial Networks](assignment3/Generative_Adversarial_Networks_PyTorch.ipynb)  (*done in PyTorch*)
